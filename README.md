# Sorani AI TV Presenter 🎤📺

This project builds a realistic **Kurdish Sorani-speaking AI TV presenter** that can deliver daily 1-minute tech and AI news updates. 
It uses [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) for training a custom text-to-speech (TTS) voice and integrates tools to generate videos with lifelike avatars.
